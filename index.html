<h4 id="whatisbitcasa">What is Bitcasa?</h4>

<p>Bitcasa is an external hard drive in the cloud that never runs out of space. You can access your data from anywhere and from any device. Ditch the external hard drives, and store your files in your Bitcasa Infinite Drive to free up space on your computer and mobile device. Never run out of space again! </p>

<hr />

<h4 id="whatkindofsecurityfeaturesareinplace">What kind of security features are in place?</h4>

<p>All of your data is private, protected, and secure. Files and folders uploaded to Bitcasa are encrypted using AES&#8211;256 bit encryption and sent over a secure connection using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</p>

<p>All data is encrypted client-side before being sent to Bitcasa. Because data is stored as encrypted blocks, we have no idea what files the blocks belong to. We can&#8217;t decrypt your data, either. Since we can&#8217;t decrypt it, we can&#8217;t see it. Data is decrypted and reconstructed only when you log in with your username and password. Your personal documents always remain personal. Keep in mind that you can retrieve any version of your files by simply picking a date or time on the versions calendar in the web portal. </p>

<hr />

<h4 id="istherealimitationonfilesize">Is there a limitation on file size?</h4>

<p>There are no restrictions on file size. Upload away! </p>

<p><em>Seriously?</em> Yeah, seriously. We don&#8217;t have any caps on file size. Remember that large amounts of data will take a bit to upload, though.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="iaccidentallydeletedafileorfolderfrommyinfinitedrive.canirecovermydata">I accidentally deleted a file or folder from my Infinite Drive. Can I recover my data?</h4>

<p>Bitcasa maintains a record of your files and folders that belong to you. When a change is made to your folders, including deletion of files or folders, we update your record and save the changes you made. To restore your files and folders, revert to a previous record by following these steps: </p>

<ol>
<li>Go to https://portal.bitcasa.com and sign in.</li>
<li>Click the Versions link on the top right. A calendar will appear.</li>
<li>Select the date and time prior to deleting the file or folder.</li>
<li>Select the folder you wish to restore and click the Share button.</li>
<li>Click the Copy Link.</li>
<li>Paste the link in a new tab or window.</li>
<li>Click the Add to your Bitcasa Drive.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can perform the same steps as above, but instead of clicking Share, click Download to download the contents of that folder. However, this may take some time to download depending on the size of that folder. We recommend performing the steps above before downloading.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="howdoirestoreabackupfrombitcasatomycomputer">How do I restore a backup from Bitcasa to my computer?</h4>

<p>Head over to the web portal and find the file or folder you want to recovery. Click on the download icon located on the right side of the page, next to the trash can icon. Your content will be downloaded in a .zip file. </p>

<hr />

<h4 id="whataretheuploadrisksdoineedtoworryaboutcorruptfiles">What are the upload risks? Do I need to worry about corrupt files?</h4>

<p>We use enterprise-grade methods to verify encryption and transmission of your data. If your transfer is interrupted, nothing is lost of corrupted. Here are some best practices to make sure your files get across smoothly:</p>

<p>Make sure you&#8217;ve got a stable connection to the net.
If you&#8217;re on a WiFI connection, double check your signal.
Plug-in your charger and adjust your power settings to keep your computer awake during transfers.
Be mindful of large file uploads!
Why can&#8217;t I play certain file types on the web portal? </p>

<p>We support a bunch of popular formats, however there are a few that require special players. If run in to the Your video cannot be played error, you can always download it and play on your local device with the correct player. We&#8217;re working to improve browser based playback! </p>

<hr />

<h4 id="whatsthebestwaytomovemyfilestobitcasa">What&#8217;s the best way to move my files to Bitcasa?</h4>

<p>Transfer data to your Infinite Driving using the copy action on your computer. If you want to delete local content after a transfer is complete, check the web portal to make sure your files are available before deleting items on your computer. </p>

<hr />

<h4 id="whatsthescoopontransferspeeds">What&#8217;s the scoop on transfer speeds?</h4>

<p>We do quite a bit of encryption work on your files before they&#8217;re sent to our servers. Assuming there is no network congestion between you and our data centers, for each 1Mbps of upload throughput, you should expect 1GB to take about 2.5 hours. 5Mbps would finish 1GB in about 25 minutes, if everything is working smoothly. Other things that affect transfer speeds: </p>

<p><strong>Packet loss:</strong> Performance will be significantly impacted if the smallest amount of packets are lost. Most often this kind of loss is a local problem (e.g. sub-optimal signal on cable modems or phone lines), but can frequently occur as traffic moves between networks, such as busy Internet exchange points in Amsterdam, London, New York, Chicago, and San Jose. Selective usage control by your ISP is also a potential issue. Most ISPs have abandoned these policies, but not all. </p>

<p><strong>Latency:</strong> This is the classic problem known as the &#8220;fat, long pipe&#8221;. TCP was designed way before the kinds of ubiquitous high speed links we have today. Many improvements have been attempted over the decades, but not all are enabled by default, or effective under certain conditions. Our current datacenter is located in Northern California. </p>

<p>If you are not on the North American continent, you are may have performance that is less than optimal. We are exploring additional datacenters around the world to improve performance for our non-US customers. </p>

<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Many low-end consumer routers can&#8217;t handle high traffic rates. You&#8217;d see this reflected in speed tests though. Some devices have very large or very small buffers, both of which can impact TCP algorithms. </p>
